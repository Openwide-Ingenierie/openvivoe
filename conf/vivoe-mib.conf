# this is the configuration file for the VIVOE-MIB module
# This is were the initialization of the VIVOE-MIB's parameters is done.
# You should defined the different groups of the MIB as follows:
#	[GroupName]
# All the groups: 
#	_deviceInfo
#	_VideoFormatInfo
#	_ChannelControl
#	_ViveoNotification
#	_VivoeGroups
# Sould be present in the MIB Even if all the parameters they contained are not assigned. 
#
# Then you should set the value of all parameters you want ot initialize in the MIB as:
# 	parameter=value
# You should respedt the type of each variable as defined in the MIB: Integer, String on
# 16, 32, 64 bits or less. 
# IpAddresses will be assigned with strings: An example would be:
#	ethernetIfIpAddress="127.0.0.1" or ethernetIfIpAddress=127.0.0.1
#Optional parameter are commented, if you wan to initialize them, just uncomment the line
#Line which are not commented, are mandatory, they have to be initialized.
#Fot the parameters contained in table, the value for each line should be initialized, separated by ";"
#Also, about the synthax:
#space before and after "=" signs are ignored
#blank line between two keys are ignored

# This group assigned the values to the MIB's parameters of the deviceInfo section
[deviceInfo]

# This is optional
deviceDesc=This is a Desc

# This is optional
deviceManufacturer=Company's name

# This is optional
devicePartNumber=Part Number here

# This is optional

# This is mandatory
deviceType=3

# This is optional
deviceUserDesc=This is a User Desc

# This is mandatory
# Put the name of network interfaces you want VIVOE to use
# You can use several ethernet Interfaces, however, only one can handle
# The SNMP requests and manage the MIB. This will be the "primary" interface. Others will be "secondaries" interfaces.
# List all the interfaces below, the first one will be the Primary interface, others will be secondaries.

ethernetInterface=enp2s0;lo

# This is optional

# This is mandatory
deviceMode=2

# This is mandatory
deviceReset=1

# The following groups define the parameter associated to a videoChannel
# The following groups should be named as follows [source_num] wher "num" is a number comrpise between
# 1 and nb_screens
[source_1]
# This is optional
# Define here a description that will be associated the source
channelUserDesc=Camera1
# This is mandatory
# Define here the gstreamer command line used to get the source
#gst_source=v4l2src device=/dev/video0 ! capsfilter caps="video/x-raw,width=1920,height=1080,interlace-mode=(string)progressive,framerate=(fraction)30/1" ! avenc_mpeg4

[channelControl]
# This is mandatory
# Define here the number of screens (service User in VIVOE terminology) you want this device to handle
nb_screens=1

[receiver_1]
# This parameter is used to specify the default video source to associate to a Service User channel
# This will be the source that will be streamed immedialtely if the device is in defaultStartUp mode
# This should always start with 239.192, byte three of IP address is the channelIndex emitting the steam 
# and final byte of the steam is last byte of the device's IP address which emits the stream.
# For more information, refer to section 7.1.1
# for example : default_source=239.192.1.119
#this is optional
defaultReceiveIP=239.192.2.119
