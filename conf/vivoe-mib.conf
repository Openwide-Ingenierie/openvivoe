# this is the configuration file for the VIVOE-MIB module
# This is were the initialization of the VIVOE-MIB's parameters is done.
# You should defined the different groups of the MIB as follows:
#	[GroupName]
# All the groups: 
#	_deviceInfo
#	_VideoFormatInfo
#	_ChannelControl
#	_ViveoNotification
#	_VivoeGroups
# Sould be present in the MIB Even if all the parameters they contained are not assigned. 
#
# Then you should set the value of all parameters you want ot initialize in the MIB as:
# 	parameter=value
# You should respedt the type of each variable as defined in the MIB: Integer, String on
# 16, 32, 64 bits or less. 
# IpAddresses will be assigned with strings: An example would be:
#	ethernetIfIpAddress="127.0.0.1" or ethernetIfIpAddress=127.0.0.1
#Optional parameter are commented, if you wan to initialize them, just uncomment the line
#Line which are not commented, are mandatory, they have to be initialized.
#Fot the parameters contained in table, the value for each line should be initialized, separated by ";"
#Also, about the synthax:
#space before and after "=" signs are ignored
#blank line between two keys are ignored

# This group assigned the values to the MIB's parameters of the deviceInfo section
