# this is the configuration file of OpenVivoe
# this is where you will initialize some parameter for the MIB group deviceInfo
# and where you will configure OpenVivoe's sources and receivers
# [GroupName]
# All the groups:
#	_ deviceInfo
#	_ source_x
# 	_ receiver_y
#
# Then you should set the value of all parameters you want ot initialize in the MIB as:
# 	parameter=value
# You should respedt the type of each variable as defined in the MIB: Integer, String on
# 16, 32, 64 bits or less.
# IpAddresses will be assigned with strings: An example would be:
#	ethernetIfIpAddress="127.0.0.1" or ethernetIfIpAddress=127.0.0.1
#Optional parameter are commented, if you wan to initialize them, just uncomment the line
#Line which are not commented, are mandatory, they have to be initialized.
#Fot the parameters contained in table, the value for each line should be initialized, separated by ";"
#Also, about the synthax:
#space before and after "=" signs are ignored
#blank line between two keys are ignored

# This group assigned the values to the MIB's parameters of the deviceInfo section

# This will show how to configure a redirection in OpenVivoe. A redirection is when the stream of the pipeline of a Service User (receiver) is redirect and become the video
# source for the pipeline of a Service Provider (source). After or before the stream is redirected the user can change it as he wants. In the following example a thermal filter is applied
# to the stream redirected. Other usefull process could be:
# 	_ 	change the video format encoding: a J2K stream received on a device with a powerfull GPU could be decoded, and re-encoded to a MPEG-4 stream. The result would be to have the stream multicast
# 		in several encodings on the network. So it could be received by device that support hardwars decoding for J2K, and other devices that support hardwars decoding for MPEG-4.
# 	_ 	add filters to the stream, but still get the stream in its original form
# 	_ 	condense several pipeline for receveirs to the pipeline of a source to get a patchwork of several streams into one.
