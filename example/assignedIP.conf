# this is the configuration file of OpenVivoe
# this is where you will initialize some parameter for the MIB group deviceInfo
# and where you will configure OpenVivoe's sources and receivers
# [GroupName]
# All the groups:
#	_ deviceInfo
#	_ source_x
# 	_ receiver_y
#
# Then you should set the value of all parameters you want ot initialize in the MIB as:
# 	parameter=value
# You should respedt the type of each variable as defined in the MIB: Integer, String on
# 16, 32, 64 bits or less.
# IpAddresses will be assigned with strings: An example would be:
#	ethernetIfIpAddress="127.0.0.1" or ethernetIfIpAddress=127.0.0.1
#Optional parameter are commented, if you wan to initialize them, just uncomment the line
#Line which are not commented, are mandatory, they have to be initialized.
#Fot the parameters contained in table, the value for each line should be initialized, separated by ";"
#Also, about the synthax:
#space before and after "=" signs are ignored
#blank line between two keys are ignored

# This group assigned the values to the MIB's parameters of the deviceInfo section

# There follows an example of configuration to use the VIVOE standard's  static IP assignment scheme.
# You can directly set the IP you want the device to use in the key assignedIP, but you must ensure first that there will be no conflict 
# with the other IP on the network. This IP must be in the range 192.168.204.1 to 192.168.204.253. 
# If a conflict is detected, then the device will send a TRAP message to the manager and randomly select an IP between 
# 192.169.204.200 and 192.168.204.253 and restart the IP confilct detection.

# This is mandatory
# Put the name of network interfaces you want VIVOE to use
# You can use several ethernet Interfaces, however, only one can handle
# The SNMP requests and manage the MIB. This will be the "primary" interface. Others will be "secondaries" interfaces.
# List all the interfaces below, the first one will be the Primary interface, others will be secondaries.

# This is mandatory
# define here what IP assignement scheme you want OpenVivoe to use
# by default it will be using the system network configuration, DHCP or other mechanism
# otherwise it will use its own IP assignment scheme as described in the MIB

# This is optional
# It is used to store the value of the IP set by the manager
# You can set it if you want to change the IP of the device, but this is really dangerous
# You should put that in the form assignedIP_ifname where ifname is the name of one of the interfaces you
# entered in ethernetInterface list.
# This key will be overwirtted if the manager set to the device a new IP.
